13r623lVlo###1593736443177###41790310###Customer is asking about the free-trial plan. I checked in our diagnostic tool it shows that there is the "Arlo Smart Premier 1 year" will expire on aAugust 2020 but it has an amount of 12.99USD.

I confirmed this to the customer and asked for the screenshot it seems like this is for the CVR plan. I am thinking that there might be any information mess up in the system?

Customer would like to have a resoution of the issue since it will affect his camera recordings. Please assist. Thank you!#%#1593736465698###Disconnected:###INFIESTO, NINA JAN OCANA has been disconnected. Chat consult terminated.#%#
