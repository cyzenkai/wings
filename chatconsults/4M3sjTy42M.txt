One moment. #%#1592701133878###CAMPILAN, JEFF DUGAN###Thank you.#%#1592701330875###CAMPILAN, JEFF DUGAN###The customer is saying this :#%#1592701335447###CAMPILAN, JEFF DUGAN###In the Google Home app, there is a setting for the Arlo Doorbell that says, "Voice notifications." I have that turned on. When I click on the setting, it says, "Get alerts on Assistant speakers and displays. Notifications may also need to be turned on in the partner app."#%#1592701529748###INFIESTO, NINA JAN OCANA###Upon further checking, the Google assistant only supports live streaming.#%#1592701563915###INFIESTO, NINA JAN OCANA###Currently, it is Alexa that has feature of announcing if somebody pressed the doorbell#%#1592701680192###CAMPILAN, JEFF DUGAN###Okay, thanks.
