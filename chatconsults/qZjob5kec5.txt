Hi,

I need your assistance on this case number  41752594 the customer is unable to login to his Arlo account with 2FA. Cx tried to reinstall the system using a different email however he also enabled the 2FA  with the new email address. As per the customer, he is not receiving any verification code when he tried to send it via email, SMS, and push notifications. I verified that he is using the same phone when setting up the 2fa. We also tried to reinstall the app and allow all permissions and also to use his computer browser but that doesn't work either.
