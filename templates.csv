83,140567,PINK TINT EMAIL,"Hi Andrew,<br><br>I hope you are doing well!<br><br>Thank you for your prompt response through our email channel and for sending us an attachment. Upon checking, it seems that the camera has deemed defective after all the troubleshooting we&apos;ve done. Hence, we are going to process an RMA request for the affected camera. Thus, we would like to offer a shipping waive process for you to expedite shipment as a delivery option, and when shipping fee will be waived our system requires a credit card for the replacement process to go through. Your credit card will only be used as collateral for us to waive the shipping fee.<br><br>A $2.00 temporary authorization hold will be placed on your credit card. Any such charge will be removed automatically from your card account and will not need to be paid. These authorizations can have the temporary effect of reducing the available balance for the account, but they will automatically expire and drop off the account eventually. The duration for which an authorization remains on the account varies by issuing bank or card type, and cannot be controlled by ARLO.<br><br>Once our warehouse receives the defective device, the $2.00 temporary authorization hold will be credited back to your card. The only time that your credit card will be charged automatically if the unit is not returned on time (10 business days from the date that the replacement device is received). This fee is equivalent to the current listing price of the device. I can assure you that no money will be charged from your credit card. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your feedback.<br><br>I would like to gather additional information so that we can proceed accordingly with your RMA request:<br><br>1.

137,140567,NOT DETECTING MOTION,"Hi Bradley,<br><br><br>I hope you are doing fine!<br><br>Thank you for submitting your concern through our email channel. Please know that we will do our best to address your concern in the least amount of time.<br><br>As I understand your concern, one of your Arlo Ultra cameras is not detecting motion. May I know what else have you done so far? Any troubleshooting steps taken before contacting us? One probable cause for this to happen is that the camera is too far from the base station. With this, you may try the following troubleshooting steps as laid out below:<br><br>Note: Please make sure to follow the troubleshooting below for us to isolate further the issue and for us to know if there are changes after the troubleshooting.<br><br>1. Camera positioning:<br>> Ensure that your camera isn’t looking through glass or other transparent objects because camera’s motion sensor decreases in performance when it is aimed to look through glass, plastic, or a mirror.<br>>Keep active locations in the camera&apos;s field of view. Position your camera so that the space that you want to monitor is within the camera&apos;s field of view.<br>> Elevate your camera. Mount your Arlo motion-detection camera at least 7 feet (2.1 meters) above the floor and aim it slightly downward for the best sensor performance.<br>> Ensure that side-to-side traffic crosses Arlo&apos;s field of view. Arlo&apos;s motion sensor is much more sensitive to side-to-side movement across its field of view than to movement directly toward or away from the camera. The best area for motion detection is 5 feet to 20 feet (1.5 to 6 meters) from the camera position.<br><br>2. Create a custom mode:<br>Please follow these steps:<br><br>1. Launch the Arlo app or log in to your Arlo account at my.arlo.com.<br>2. Tap or click Mode > Tap or click the base station > Tap or click Add a Mode.<br>3. Enter a name for the mode and tap or click Next. The Trigger Device page displays.<br>4. Tap or click the camera as the trigger device for a rule and then tap or click Next. Since you are using an Arlo Pro 2 Wire-Free camera please select motion is detected as the action then tap or click Next.<br>5. Set the Motion Sensitivity using the slider and tap or click Next. When prompted, specify that you want the camera to detect motion.<br>Note: You can select Record video or Do nothing.<br>6. If you selected Record video, use the slider to specify how long you want your device to record for motion is detected and tap or click Next.<br>7. Select the notifications that you want to receive and tap or click Next.<br>8. If you selected Email Alerts, enter the email addresses that you want to receive alerts and tap or click Next.<br>9. Review the summary of your settings and tap or click Save. Your new mode is saved.<br>Note: If you did not select Record video, you will not be able to save.<br>10. From the mode menu, tap the pencil icon or click > next to the mode that you just created.<br>Tap or click Add Rule and do the same process to the other cameras.<br>11.

180,181875,CAMERA OFFLINE,"<br>1.If your camera is offline after you switched to a new router or made changes to your Internet network, press and release the Sync button on the Arlo SmartHub or Arlo base station.<br>2.Open and close your camera battery door and notice the camera LED behavior when the door is closed<br>3.Check the camera connectivity<br>   •Note the distance between the camera and the base station. You can place your Arlo camera a maximum of 300 feet (90 meters) from the base station. If your camera is farther away <br>    from the base station, it might be connecting and disconnecting because of the distance from the base station.<br>   •Note the number of walls between the camera and the base station. Your camera might go offline if metal objects or thick walls and ceilings exist between the camera and the base <br>    station.<br>   •Do you have an access point or other WiFi device close to the base station? If so, your Arlo system might be experiencing WiFi congestion. If possible, move the base station away from <br>    other WiFi devices.<br>4.Check your Arlo SmartHub or base station status:<br>  • If the Internet LED on your base station is solid green, the base station is connected to the Internet.<br>  •If the LED is amber, the base station is not connected to the Internet. Verify that the Ethernet cable is connected to a LAN connection. <br>5.Ensure that your camera is synced to the base station<br>   •Check your Arlo library for the last recording for that camera. If the most recent video for that camera was recorded a long time ago, the camera might not be synced to the base <br>    station. <br>   •Open and close the camera battery door. If the LED blinks blue once and it does not rapidly blink blue later, you must resync your camera.<br><br>You may use this link as a reference: https://kb.arlo.com/1133448/My-Arlo-wire-free-camera-is-offline-how-can-I-troubleshoot-it"

When the LEDs stop flashing amber, your base station reboots. Resetting the base station <br>   also removes it from your Arlo account.<br>2.When the Power and Internet LEDs are both solid green, tap the Arlo icon on your mobile device and log in to your Arlo app. You can also enter my.arlo.com in the address bar of a <br>   browser.<br>3.Click or tap New System Setup.<br>4.Follow the on-screen instructions.<br><br>You may use this link as a reference: https://kb.arlo.com/1057976/How-can-I-reset-my-Arlo-SmartHub-or-base-station-to-the-default-values"

Make <br>   sure that you can browse the Internet from this device.<br>      •If you cannot browse the Internet from the device, you need to restore your router&apos;s connection to the Internet.<br>      •If you can browse the Internet from the device, continue troubleshooting.<br>4.Power cycle your base station.<br>   To power cycle your base station, unplug the power adapter from the outlet, wait two minutes, and reconnect the power adapter to the outlet. The base station takes one to two <br>   minutes to start. When the power LED and Internet LED light solid green, your base station is connected to the Internet. If the Internet LED is amber, continue troubleshooting.<br>5.Check your router&apos;s DHCP settings and client list.<br>   Ensure that DHCP is enabled and that router&apos;s DHCP client list supplied an IP address to the base station (if it did, the base station appears in the client list.) For more information, see <br>   your router documentation. <br>6.If you were previously able to connect your base station to the Internet but now cannot connect, check the router&apos;s security settings and firmware to ensure that no changes were made <br>   since the last time it successfully connected.<br>   You might want to temporarily lower the security settings on the router or temporarily place the base station in the DMZ to rule out any firewall restrictions. If you make these changes, <br>   power cycle your base station as described in Step 4.<br>7.Check to make sure that ports 443 and 80 are open on your router.<br>   If you do not manage your Internet environment, contact your IT department for assistance with any firewall or router configurations. The Arlo base station cannot connect through <br>   most proxy servers. Check with your IT team and Internet service provider (ISP) about ways to bypass any proxy servers. Ask your IT team to ensure that ports 443 and 80 are open.<br>8.Perform a factory reset on your base station.<br><br>You may refer to this link for reference: https://kb.arlo.com/996/My-Arlo-SmartHub-or-base-station-is-offline-how-can-I-troubleshoot-it"

Rest assured, we will use all our resources to address your concern in the least amount of time. I understand that your cameras battery seem draining fast than expected. One probabel reason why it will drain fast is the are where the camera was placed.<br><br>Arlo battery-powered cameras are not intended for continuous recording. The batteries in your Arlo Pro or Arlo Wire-Free camera last for about four to six months with normal usage, which is about five minutes of recordings a day. <br><br>Use these tips to maximize your camera&apos;s battery life:<br>•Only use the rechargeable batteries that were supplied inside you package or replacement batteries from Arlo.<br>•Ensure that your Arlo system is running the latest firmware. <br>•Use the Optimized or Best Battery Life power setting. <br>•Configure your cameras to record shorter videos.<br>•Position your Arlo Wire-Free or Arlo Pro Wire-Free camera a maximum of 300 feet (90 meters) from the base station.<br>•Do not place your Arlo system near multiple WiFi routers.<br><br>These environmental factors can shorten battery life:<br><br>•Placing your cameras in temperatures below 32°F (0°C).<br><br>You may use this link as a reference: https://kb.arlo.com/291/How-can-I-extend-my-Arlo-camera-s-battery-life<br><br>You may perform these troubleshooting steps for isolation purposes:<br><br>1.Swap batteries with a working camera.

Use a WiFi analyzer to test the WiFi noise in your environment.<br>   • Download the WiFi analyzers. This enables you to review details such as the channel your device is currently using, which channels re currently in use by other networks in the area and <br>      suggest the best channel for your network.<br>   •If you are able to find a channel that is less congested, login to your router setting and change the WiFi channel.

192,181875,TOO MUCH MOTION DETECTION,"On probable reason for it to detect motion is the area where the camera was placed. Just to give you a heads up, when the infrared technology detects an object that is warmer than the surrounding environment. The motion sensor is more sensitive to side-to-side movement across its field of view than to movement directly toward or away from the camera. The motion sensitivity settings range from one (low sensitivity) to 100 (high sensitivity). We could not yet conclude if there was a camera issue not unless we have isolated the possible reasons. With that, you may perform these troubleshooting steps to rectify the issue:<br><br>1.Changed camera location and see if it detects motion abnormally<br>2.Create a new custom mode for that camera and observe<br>3.Check the motion settings. Set to lowest then save.<br>4.Camera position<br>Mount your Arlo camera at least 7 feet (2.1 meters) above the floor or ground, angle it slightly downward, and place it within 10-15 feet (3.0-4.6 meters) of where motion is expected.<br>Make sure that side-to-side traffic crosses the camera&apos;s field of view. The camera&apos;s motion sensor is more sensitive to side-to-side movement across its field of view than to movement<br>directly toward or away from the camera.

This article provides the most common Geofencing troubleshooting solutions.<br><br>•You’re using the old Arlo Legacy app<br>When you install the new Arlo app, Geofencing stops working on the old version of the app (the Arlo Legacy app). When you log in to the new Arlo app for the first time on your iOS or<br>Android device, and if you had Geofencing active on the Legacy app, the new app invites you to add that device to the list of ‘Enabled Devices.’ Enabled Devices can trigger Geofencing<br>Home/Away mode changes.<br>•Your iOS or Android device is not sharing its location information with the Arlo system<br>For Arlo Geofencing to work on your device, you must adjust your settings as follows:<br><br>•Android devices<br>•Location permission = ON<br>•Location services = ON<br>• Battery saver = OFF<br>•Data limit = OFF<br>• Airplane mode = OFF<br>•iOS (Apple) devices<br>•Share my location = ON<br>•Location services = Always<br>•Airplane mode = OFF<br><br>•One or more iOS or Android devices are still in the Device Location zone<br>We strongly recommend that you enable only one iOS or Android device per physical user on an Arlo account. This should be the device that you carry every day. For example, if you<br>routinely use an Android phone and an iPad, we recommend that you only set your Android phone as an Enabled Device in your Geofencing settings. The Arlo system only changes the<br>active mode from Home to Away when all enabled iOS and Android devices have left the designated Device Location in Geofencing settings. To review which mobile devices participate<br>in Geofencing, open the Arlo app and check the Enabled Devices page in Geofencing settings. Remove any devices that you do not want to trigger Home/Away mode changes. If you’re a<br>Friend on someone’s Arlo account and would like your iOS or Android device to trigger Home/Away mode changes, ask the account owner to re-enable your device for Geofencing. The<br>account owner must have migrated their iOS or Android device to the new Arlo app before re-adding friends to Geofencing. Once you install the new Arlo app on an iOS or Android<br>device, Geofencing settings are reset to ensure a smooth migration and provide you full control over Geofencing in the new app.<br>•One or more iOS or Android devices that were enabled for Geofencing changed location sharing settings. The iOS and Android operating systems routinely notify you when you are<br>sharing your location with the Arlo app. The operating system then asks if you wish to continue sharing your location.<br><br>•For iOS devices. Select the Always option for sharing your location.<br>•For Android devices. Depending on the version of Android you’re running, select Allow all the time or Allow.<br><br>If any other option is selected, your iOS or Android device stops sending location information to Arlo. The device then appears as Unavailable in the Enabled Devices page of the Arlo<br>app. If you enter or leave your Device Location zone with one of these devices, a Home or Away mode change is not triggered.<br><br>•You have a task-killing app that is interfering with Arlo Geofencing<br>A task-killing app, such as Shutapp or Doze, can disable Arlo Geofencing.

Make sure that your router is powered on and <br>   connected to the Internet.<br> •If the Internet LED lights green, perform a factory reset on your base station and try the installation process again.<br>4.If you completed these troubleshooting steps and Arlo was unable to discover your base station, you may reset the base station.<br><br>You may use this link a a reference: https://kb.arlo.com/1179130/Arlo-can-t-discover-my-SmartHub-or-base-station-during-installation-what-do-I-do<br><br>Before you perform base station reset, you may perform these steps if the issue still persist and Base station was Offline:<br><br>1.Check the Ethernet cable.<br>    Make sure that your Ethernet cable is securely connected to the base station and router and that you&apos;re using the Ethernet cable that came with your system.<br>2.Check the Power adapter.<br>   Make sure that the power adapter is securely connected to the back of your base station and securely plugged into an outlet.<br>3.Try to connect to the Internet from another device that is connected directly to your router.<br>   Use an Ethernet-connected device, not a device that is connected using WiFi (you can turn WiFi off on the device to ensure that the device is connecting using the Ethernet cable). Make <br>   sure that you can browse the Internet from this device.<br>      •If you cannot browse the Internet from the device, you need to restore your router&apos;s connection to the Internet.<br>      •If you can browse the Internet from the device, continue troubleshooting.<br>4.Power cycle your base station.<br>   To power cycle your base station, unplug the power adapter from the outlet, wait two minutes, and reconnect the power adapter to the outlet. The base station takes one to two <br>   minutes to start. When the power LED and Internet LED light solid green, your base station is connected to the Internet. If the Internet LED is amber, continue troubleshooting.<br>5.Check your router&apos;s DHCP settings and client list.<br>   Ensure that DHCP is enabled and that router&apos;s DHCP client list supplied an IP address to the base station (if it did, the base station appears in the client list.) For more information, see <br>   your router documentation. <br>6.If you were previously able to connect your base station to the Internet but now cannot connect, check the router&apos;s security settings and firmware to ensure that no changes were made <br>   since the last time it successfully connected.<br>   You might want to temporarily lower the security settings on the router or temporarily place the base station in the DMZ to rule out any firewall restrictions. If you make these changes, <br>   power cycle your base station as described in Step 4.<br>7.Check to make sure that ports 443 and 80 are open on your router.<br>   If you do not manage your Internet environment, contact your IT department for assistance with any firewall or router configurations. The Arlo base station cannot connect through <br>   most proxy servers. Check with your IT team and Internet service provider (ISP) about ways to bypass any proxy servers. Ask your IT team to ensure that ports 443 and 80 are open.<br>8.Perform a factory reset on your base station.<br><br>You may refer to this link for reference: https://kb.arlo.com/996/My-Arlo-SmartHub-or-base-station-is-offline-how-can-I-troubleshoot-it<br><br>If still the issue still persist, reset the base station:<br><br>Performing a factory reset returns your Arlo SmartHub or Arlo base station values to the default settings. It also removes the serial number from your Arlo account.<br><br>1.Use a pen or straightened paperclip to press and hold the Reset button on the back of the base station for about 10 seconds.<br>  After the base station reset is complete, the LEDs on the front of the base station flash amber. When the LEDs stop flashing amber, your base station reboots. Resetting the base station <br>  also removes it from your Arlo account.<br>2.When the Power and Internet LEDs are both solid green, tap the Arlo icon on your mobile device and log in to your Arlo app. You can also enter my.arlo.com in the address bar of a <br>   browser.<br>3.Click or tap New System Setup.<br>4.Follow the on-screen instructions.<br><br>You may refer to this link for more information: https://kb.arlo.com/1057976/How-can-I-reset-my-Arlo-SmartHub-or-base-station-to-the-default-values<br>"

You can use the Arlo app or web portal to access video footage from your Arlo cameras.<br><br>Connectivity requirements:<br><br>All Arlo cameras require a high-speed Internet connection, but each Arlo camera uses a different amount of bandwidth. Bandwidth use is measured on a per-camera basis. If you have multiple Arlo cameras on the same network, you can estimate the total bandwidth use of your entire Arlo system by adding the average bandwidth use of each camera.<br><br>Your Arlo system requires the following:<br><br>•A high-speed Internet connection to sustain the following average bandwidth use per camera:<br>      •Arlo Ultra cameras: 3 Mbps upload per camera<br>      •Arlo Pro 3 and Video Doorbell: 2 Mbps upload per camera<br>      •All other Arlo cameras: 1 Mbps upload per camera<br>•An Internet router with an available Ethernet port if you are using an Arlo SmartHub or base station.<br><br>Arlo works with the minimum requirements, but the functionality and video quality might be negatively affected. With a lower upstream bandwidth, there is a greater possibility that video quality might be pixelated and unclear. You might also experience a delay in starting a live stream.<br><br>Arlo app requirements:<br><br>To download the mobile app for your Apple or Android device, visit your device&apos;s app store and search for Arlo.<br><br>•Apple devices: For all future product and app enhancement updates, the Arlo app requires iOS version 11 or higher.<br>•Android devices: For all future product and app enhancement updates, the Arlo app requires Android version 5.0 or higher.<br><br>Second, is to connect your base station to your internet.<br><br>1.Connect the SmartHub or base station to your router using an Ethernet cable.<br>   Note: You must connect the base station to your router before you power it on. The base station might not connect to your network correctly if you power it on before connecting it to <br>              your router.<br>2.Connect the power adapter to the base station and plug it into an electrical outlet.<br>3.Turn the base station on by pressing the On-Off button.<br>4.Wait for the power LED and Internet LED on the front of the base station to turn green in about two minutes. If you&apos;re using a single-LED base station, wait for the LED to turn blue.<br>   Your base station is connected to the Internet.<br><br>Third, are the troubleshooting steps if Arlo can&apos;t discover your SmartHub or base station during installation.<br><br>To troubleshoot SmartHub or base station discovery problems:<br><br>1.Turn off your base station and unplug the Ethernet cable connecting it to your router.<br>2.Begin the installation process again, but make sure to connect your base station to your router before you power on your base station.<br>3.If Arlo still cannot discover your base station, check the color of the Internet LED on your base station:<br>    •If the Internet LED does not light after two minutes, the base station failed to connect to your router. Unplug and re-insert both ends of the Ethernet cable connecting your base station <br>      to your router. Make sure that your router is powered on.<br>    •If the Internet LED lights solid amber, your base station is connected to your router, but is unable to connect to the Arlo cloud server. Make sure that your router is powered on and <br>     connected to the Internet.<br>   •If the Internet LED lights green, perform a factory reset on your base station and try the installation process again.<br><br>You may utilize these links for more information:<br><br>https://kb.arlo.com/000062043/What-are-the-minimum-requirements-for-installing-and-using-my-Arlo-system<br><br>https://kb.arlo.com/1179139/How-do-I-connect-my-Arlo-SmartHub-or-base-station-to-the-Internet<br><br>https://kb.arlo.com/1179130/Arlo-can-t-discover-my-SmartHub-or-base-station-during-installation-what-do-I-do<br> <br>Also, please provide the following information in case we will need to proceed with other alternatives:<br><br>•What is the phone brand and version you are using to install your Arlo sysytem?<br>•After, you press the reset button what was the LED behavior of the smarthub or basestation/camera?<br>•May I have the serial number of the device you wanted to install?<br>•Is there an error message that you encounter upon the installation attempt?<br>"

The camera has synced to a base station.<br>•The LED blinks blue once. Resync the camera to the base station.<br>•The LED blinks amber. Replace the batteries.<br>3.Check the camera connectivity:<br>•Note the distance between the camera and the base station. You can place your Arlo camera a maximum of 300 feet (90 meters) from the base station. If your camera is farther away<br>from the base station, it might be connecting and disconnecting because of the distance from the base station.<br>•Note the number of walls between the camera and the base station. Your camera might go offline if metal objects or thick walls and ceilings exist between the camera and the base<br>station.<br>•Do you have an access point or other WiFi device close to the base station? If so, your Arlo system might be experiencing WiFi congestion. If possible, move the base station away from<br>other WiFi devices.<br>4.Check your Arlo SmartHub or base station status:<br>•If the Internet LED on your base station is solid green, the base station is connected to the Internet.<br>•If the LED is amber, the base station is not connected to the Internet. Verify that the Ethernet cable is connected to a LAN connection.<br>5.Ensure that your camera is synced to the base station:<br>•Check your Arlo library for the last recording for that camera. If the most recent video for that camera was recorded a long time ago, the camera might not be synced to the base<br>station.<br>•Open and close the camera battery door.
